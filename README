This is a demo of face detection and recognition.
Usage:
	1. Collect face images to be found. Note that you should include
		as more as possible face part in face image, and as less as possible
		useless part in face images, to ensure key parts reserved and face
		image can be detected as face.
		
	2. Use AddNewFace.exe(run "add_new_face.cmd") to build feature dat file "feature.dat":
		e.g. AddNewFace.exe faces_to_find
		Note that "faces_to_find" is the directory to store face images to be found.
		
	3. Use FaceDetector.exe to do detection and recognition.
		Note that you should install opencv2.4.0 and use its dlls.
